I can use UScensus2010 package
	Then I do install.blkgrp (300MB) or install.blk (2gb)
	This installs block group info, including I think geographic info
I can get demographics with 
	b<-demographics(dem = "P0010001",state="illinois", level="blkgrp")
	the 'dem' argument comes from http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/doc/sf1.pdf
		This is just the census documentation
How do I merge this with the Chicago level data?
